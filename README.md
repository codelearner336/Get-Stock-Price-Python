# Get-Stock-Price-Python
A series of programs to get a stock price from Google Finance. Each revision of the program adds more Python functionality. The 4th revision reads in user input and compares it against data in an excel. For valid input, the input is used to get a stock price by reading source code on Google Finance for a stock ticker. The stock price is then written into an excel with a time stamp.
